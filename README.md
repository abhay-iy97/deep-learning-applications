## Assignment - 1
Image classification using NN/CNN on the SVHN dataset.
- Problem 1: Implement a basic multi-layer fully connected neural network from scratch.
- Problem 2: Implement a fully functional CNN using components built in Problem 1 along with developing the Convolutional and MaxPooling layers

## Assignment - 2
- Problem 1: Implement Auto-encoder and Variational auto-encoders for the MNIST dataset
  - Set up a data loading pipeline in PyTorch.
  - Implemented, trained and visualized an auto-encoder architecture.
  - Extended the implementation to a variational auto-encoder.
  - Learnt how to tune the critical beta parameter of your VAE.
  - Inspected the learned representation of your VAE.
- Problem 2: Implemented a Transformer model for Language modeling and sentiment analysis
  - Implemented a multi-head-attention (MHA) layer.
  - Implemented the "Transformer block" layers which use MHA layers, linear layers, and residual connections.
  - Implemented a full Transformer model comprised of Transformer blocks.
  - Implemented BERT-style language model pre-training for the Transformer model.
  - Fine-tuned the trained language model on a sentiment analysis task.
